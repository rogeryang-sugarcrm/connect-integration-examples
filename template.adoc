This Quick Start was created by <partner organization> in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Quick Starts] are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy key technologies on AWS, following AWS best practices.

== Overview

This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying <software> on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who <target audience and usage scenario>.

[#_Toc535566609 .anchor]####**Please know that we may share who uses AWS Quick Starts with the AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner that collaborated with AWS on the content of the Quick Start.**

=== <software> on AWS

<Describe how the software works on AWS.>

=== Cost and licenses

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using the Quick Start.

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type, affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will use. Prices are subject to change.

*Tip:* After you deploy the Quick Start, we recommend that you enable the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-gettingstarted-turnonreports.html[AWS Cost and Usage Report]. This report delivers billing metrics to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your account. It provides cost estimates based on usage throughout each month and finalizes the data at the end of the month. For more information about the report, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-costusage.html[AWS documentation].

<license information>This Quick Start requires a license for <software>. To use the Quick Start in your production environment, sign up for a license at <link>. When you launch the Quick Start, place the license key in an S3 bucket and specify its location.

If you don’t have a license, the Quick Start deploys with a trial license. The trial license gives you <n> days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license by following the instructions at <link>.

<AMI information>The Quick Start requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for <software>, which is available from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace]. Additional pricing, terms, and conditions may apply. For instructions, see link:#step-2.-subscribe-to-the-software-ami[step 2] in the deployment section.

== Architecture

Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with *default parameters* builds the following <software> environment in the AWS Cloud.

image:docs/media/media/image1.png[image,width=648,height=439]

Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for <software> on AWS

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*

* In the private subnets:

* <describe any additional components>.

*** The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.

== Planning the deployment

=== Specialized knowledge

[#_Automated_Deployment .anchor]####This Quick Start assumes familiarity with <knowledge expectations>.

This deployment guide also requires a moderate level of familiarity with AWS services. If you’re new to AWS, visit the https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center] and the https://aws.amazon.com/training/[AWS Training and Certification website]. These sites provide materials for learning how to design, deploy, and operate your infrastructure and applications on the AWS Cloud.

=== AWS account

If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com/[https://aws.amazon.com] by following the on-screen instructions. Part of the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.

Your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services. You are charged only for the services you use.

=== Technical requirements

Before you launch the Quick Start, your account must be configured as specified in the following table. Otherwise, deployment might fail.

[cols=",",]
|===
|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[Resources] a|
If necessary, request https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[service quota increases] for the following resources. You might need to do this if an existing deployment uses these resources, and you might exceed the default quotas with this deployment. The https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[Service Quotas console] displays your usage and quotas for some aspects of some services. For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[AWS documentation].

|https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[Regions] |This deployment includes <service>, which isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html[Service Endpoints and Quotas] in the AWS documentation.
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Key pair] a|
Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in the Region where you plan to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair name. You need it during deployment. To create a key pair, follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[instructions in the AWS documentation].

For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair instead of using one that’s already being used by a production instance.

|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html[IAM permissions] |Before launching the Quick Start, you must log in to the AWS Management Console with IAM permissions for the resources and actions the templates deploy. The _AdministratorAccess_ managed policy within IAM provides sufficient permissions, although your organization may choose to use a custom policy with more restrictions.
|===

=== Deployment options

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy <software> into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys <software> into this new VPC.
* *Deploy <software> into an existing VPC*. This option provisions <software> in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and <software> settings, as discussed later in this guide.

== Deployment steps

=== Step 1. Sign in to your AWS account

[arabic]
. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#planning-the-deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide.
. Make sure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#technical-requirements[Technical requirements] section.

=== Step 2. Subscribe to the <software> AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for <software> in AWS Marketplace.

[arabic]
. Sign in to your AWS account.

[arabic]
. Open the page for the <software> AMI in AWS Marketplace, and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*.

A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation].

[arabic]
. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplace—the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

=== Step 3. Launch the Quick Start

*Note:* You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using this Quick Start. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS service used by this Quick Start. Prices are subject to change.

[arabic]
. Sign in to your AWS account, and choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. For help with choosing an option, see link:#_Automated_Deployment[deployment options] earlier in this guide.

[cols=",",]

|file:///C:\Users\handans\Desktop\new%20doc%20template\tbd[Deploy <software> into a +
new VPC on AWS] |file:///C:\Users\handans\Desktop\new%20doc%20template\tbd[Deploy <software> into an +
existing VPC on AWS]
|===

*Important:* If you’re deploying <software> into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances, and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways] in their route tables, to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet.

Also, make sure that the domain name option in the DHCP options is configured as explained in the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[Amazon VPC documentation]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about <x> minutes to complete.

[arabic, start=3]
. Check the AWS Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This is where the network infrastructure for <software> will be built. The template is launched in the <specify default AWS Region> Region by default.

*Note:* This deployment includes Amazon EFS, which isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/elasticfilesystem.html[endpoints and quotas webpage].

[arabic, start=4]
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary.

In the following tables, parameters are listed by category and described separately for the two deployment options:

* link:#option-1-parameters-for-deploying-software-into-a-new-vpc[Parameters for deploying <software> into a new VPC]
* link:#option-2-parameters-for-deploying-software-into-an-existing-vpc[Parameters for deploying <software> into an existing VPC]

When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.

== <Other useful information> 

<Add any other details that will help the customer use the software on AWS.>

== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)

*Important:* When you set *Rollback on failure* to *No*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation].
